# vgvishesh
I am Vishesh Gupta. I am a computer programmer at heart and like to experiment with new technologies. Over the past 10 years I have developed quite a handful of critical data systems and mentored junior programmers and fellow team mates to develop massively huge, maintainable code bases by instilling clean coding practises. Below are some of the products that I have worked on:

1. Games *(Ubisoft)* 
    - Just Dance 2016
    - Just Dance 2017
    - Monoploly PC
2. Kindle Data Delivery Pipelines *(Amazon)*
3. Distributed Data Annotation Pipelines *([Playment](https://playment.io))*

I hold Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering from [Jaypee Institute of Information Technology](https://www.jiit.ac.in/)

My master's thesis project : [Escape Route Animation Toolkit](https://prezi.com/osiar1gkjopx/escape-route-animation-toolkit/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)

I like to nerd around on blockchains and Web3, defi, DAOs, NFTs, Data Structures/Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Clean Coding Practises, Mathematics.
1. [Point cloud Rendering Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnP9Drw8TDE)
2. [Draw my Dance](https://youtu.be/doDdoBb_wWs)
3. [LearnaQuest](https://youtu.be/eT1HIXpiJVE)
4. [Feesible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16PUC82GaQ)
5. [Augmented Reality Sketching Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPUoyU4ZtZM)


Presently, I am researching and realizing ideas around Web3. Web3 is an interesting and powerful territory to solve the problems of trust between online users anonymously. 

This blog is where I share the results of my study/nerding/hobbies. If there is an interesting idea that you would like to collaborate with me on, please reach out to me via email. 

*Thanks for your attention,*
<br>*Cheers*
