  <div class="container-narrow content-narrow">
    <div class="content-section">
      <p>Over the last decade, I've worked at early-stage startups, scale-ups, and high-growth companies where the stakes were real — production systems, paying customers, tight timelines, and imperfect information.</p>
      
      <p>I've co-founded startups, led backend architecture for AI and data platforms, and owned systems that processed hundreds of thousands of events per day. Some ventures worked, some didn't — but each one sharpened my ability to distinguish what sounds exciting from what actually creates value.</p>
      
      <p>What stayed constant was this: my role was never just to write code, but to design systems that teams could trust, operate, and grow with.</p>

        <div class="strength-card">
          <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
          <p>Designing architectures that survive real-world usage — not just demos. I focus on reliability, observability, and clarity from day one.</p>

          <h3>Execution Under Uncertainty</h3>

      <h2>How this connects to AI today</h2>
      <p>AI is not a feature you "add". It's a capability that touches data, workflows, trust, and risk.</p>
      
      <p>My background in distributed systems and production reliability allows me to approach AI adoption pragmatically — focusing on:</p>
      
      <p>– Where AI actually reduces effort<br>
      – Where it introduces risk<br>
      – How it fits into existing processes<br>
      – And how teams can operate it long-term</p>
      
      <p>I don't sell tools. I help businesses decide if, where, and how AI makes sense for them.</p>
