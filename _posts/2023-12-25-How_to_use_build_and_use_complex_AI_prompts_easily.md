Introducing **[AI Prompter](https://ai-prompter.vercel.app/)**, your AI buddy to help you ask complex questions to AI easily. Using this simple interface you can build higly complex and intricate prompts and also get them answered by ChatGpt. This tool uses ***[Megamind's APIs](https://mega-mind.io/)*** to answer your queries. 

Some of the AI tasks that you can do using this application:
1. Suggest some food recepies with ***@ingredients*** to cook ***@cuisine***. 
2. Build cover letters for ***@your_profile*** and ***@job_description***.
3. Plan travel to ***@destination***, to do ***@activites*** for ***@duration*** days.

*many more...*

In the above examples the `@property` notation helps you keep your query clean, and this app replaces the value of these properties with their values before you submit your prompt to AI. 

You can use as many ***properties*** as you may like to build your prompts. Lets see how can you use this application to your best advantage. <br>

***Note:*** For folks who prefer to watch and learn, here is a **[video tutorial](#video-walkthrough-tutorial)** explain how to use this app

### About the app
**Use the app here** :
<button style="background-color: blue; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border: none; border-radius: 10px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;" onclick="window.open(`https://ai-prompter.vercel.app/`, '_blank')">AI Prompter</button>

**Description** : This apps allow you to create complex AI prompts/commands to ask AI. It uses the concept of referencing with `@` symbol as we do when writing any post on LinkedIn, Twitter or even refer people in whatsapp groups. 

**How does it work** <br>
On opening the app for the first time. You will see the below interface.
![AI Prompter Raw](/assets/images/ai_prompter_raw.png)

There are **4** main parts of this interface: <br>
1. #### Custom Data: 
In this section, you will see `Add key` option by default. It is there to add properties called keys and their values. These can be later referenced in the **[Prompt section](#prompt)** using `@` symbol. 
On clicking the `Add Key` button the interface will change to allow you to add a key and its value:
![AI Prompter Add key](/assets/images/ai_prompter_addKey.png)

2. #### Prompt : 
In this section, you will write the prompt/command that you want AI to answer. Here, you can refer the properties that you created in the previous section using `@` symbol, to form the entire prompt. Lets see this in action:
![AI Prompter Prompt](/assets/images/ai_prompter_prompt.png)

3. #### Prompt Submitted : 
On submitting the prompt created in the previous section, the entire prompt will be displayed in this section, so that you can see what is the final prompt that AI is going to work on. E.g:
![AI Prompter Submission](/assets/images/ai_prompter_submission.png)
As you can see the properties referenced with `@` symbol got replaced with their values provided in [Custom Data](#custom-data) section.

4. #### Response:
On submitting the prompt, the AI gets starts working on your prompt, and this section displays the answer generated by AI. E.g:
![AI Prompter Response](/assets/images/ai_prompter_response.png)

### More examples:
#### Generate a prompt for AI to create a cover letter to apply for a job. 
Here is one more example to use this app. Here we will build a prompt to ask AI to generate a cover letter for a job. Lets start:
#### Final Prompt:
```
Generate a crispt and powerful cover letter for @my_profile for job with description @job_description. 
```
As you can see we want to use 2 properties in our final prompt, namely:
1. my_profile
2. job_description

Below is how you create these properties in the [Custom Data](#custom-data) section.
