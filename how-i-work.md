Most AI projects fail not because the technology is bad, but because it's introduced too quickly, in the wrong places, and without clear ownership.

My approach is designed to avoid that — by earning trust step by step.

## My Process

I work with teams that are exploring AI carefully to introduce AI in ways that are safe, measurable, and reversible. Here's how we typically proceed:

### Discovery Phase

We start by understanding your current workflows, pain points, and constraints. This isn't about selling you on AI—it's about identifying where it actually makes sense.

**Why this matters:** Prevents solving the wrong problem with the right tools.

### Pilot Selection

Together, we identify 1–2 workflows where AI can provide immediate value without risking critical business functions. These are usually internal processes where humans maintain control.

**Why this matters:** Focuses effort where impact is highest and risk is lowest.

### Controlled Implementation

We build small, human-in-the-loop pilots. No auto-sending. No irreversible decisions. No disruption to your existing systems.

**Why this matters:** Builds confidence through safe, reversible steps.

### Measurement & Iteration

We measure outcomes carefully. If something doesn't save time or improve quality, we stop. If it works, we expand carefully.

**Why this matters:** Ensures we only expand what actually works.

## What Makes This Different

- **Safety first**: We rule out risky use cases before building anything
- **Human-centered**: AI supports your team, it doesn't replace judgment
- **Measurable**: Clear metrics and outcomes, not vague promises
- **Reversible**: Nothing we build locks you into a path you can't change

## Typical Timeline

- **Week 1–2**: Discovery and workflow analysis
- **Week 3–4**: Pilot design and setup
- **Week 5–8**: Pilot execution and measurement
- **Week 9+**: Iteration or expansion based on results

Every engagement is different, but this structure ensures we move thoughtfully and measure progress along the way.

## What teams usually feel after this process

Less anxiety about AI decisions. Clear ownership and boundaries. Confidence to expand only what works.
