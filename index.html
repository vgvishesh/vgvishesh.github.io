      <h2>You're probably curious about AI — and cautious for good reasons</h2>
      <p>If you're running a growing business, you may be thinking:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>"AI sounds promising, but we can't afford mistakes with customers or data."</li>
        <li>"We don't have clean data or strong technical people internally."</li>
        <li>"Every AI pitch feels overhyped and vague."</li>
        <li>"We want efficiency, not experiments."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That hesitation isn't a weakness — it's good judgment.</p>
      <p>Most businesses don't fail with AI because the technology is bad. They fail because it's introduced too fast, in the wrong places, without guardrails.</p>
      <p><strong>My job is to help you avoid that.</strong></p>

<!-- Section 3: What I Help With (Light → Dark transition) -->
<section class="section section-light" aria-label="What I help you do">
  <div class="container-narrow">
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>What I actually help you do</h2>
      <p>I don't start with tools or models. I start with your workflows.</p>
      <p>My work typically focuses on:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Reducing repetitive manual work (ops, support, reporting, internal coordination)</li>
        <li>Improving response times and consistency without auto‑sending or auto‑deciding</li>
        <li>Helping teams use AI as a <em>drafting and decision‑support tool</em>, not a replacement</li>
        <li>Introducing AI in ways that are reversible, measurable, and safe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal is simple: <strong>earn trust first, then compound value.</strong></p>

          <span class="approach-step-number">1</span>
          <h3>Decide where AI should <em>not</em> be used</h3>
          <p>Before building anything, we rule out risky or low‑ROI use cases. This alone saves time and money.</p>

        <div class="approach-step">
          <span class="approach-step-number">2</span>
          <h3>Identify 1–2 workflows where AI can help immediately</h3>
          <p>Usually internal or draft‑based workflows where humans stay in control.</p>

        <div class="approach-step">
          <span class="approach-step-number">3</span>
          <h3>Run a small, human‑in‑the‑loop pilot</h3>
          <p>No auto‑sending. No irreversible decisions. No disruption to your existing systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="approach-step">
          <span class="approach-step-number">4</span>
          <h3>Measure outcomes, then expand carefully</h3>

<!-- Section 5: Why Me (Dark) -->
<section class="section section-dark" aria-label="Why work with me">
  <div class="container-narrow">
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Why work with me</h2>
      <p>I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience building and scaling production systems — the kind that fail loudly when things are done carelessly.</p>
      <p>I've led products from zero to real revenue, worked with messy data, evolving requirements, and real business pressure. That background shapes how I approach AI today.</p>
      <p>I don't optimise for demos or hype. I optimise for:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Reliability over novelty</li>
        <li>Clear ownership and accountability</li>
        <li>Guardrails instead of blind automation</li>
        <li>Business outcomes, not buzzwords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's why many teams find this work reassuring rather than disruptive.</p>
