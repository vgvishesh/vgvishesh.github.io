      <dt>Is my data secure?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. Private deployment options ensure your data never leaves your environment. No public AI models are used.</dd>
      <dt>Does this replace patent attorneys?</dt>
      <dd>No. The copilot drafts first versions; attorneys review, refine, and approve. You stay in control.</dd>
      <dt>Do we need to change our workflow?</dt>
      <dd>Minimal change. You paste or upload material as you do today; the copilot produces a structured draft for you to refine.</dd>
      <dt>How long does deployment take?</dt>
      <dd>Depends on your environment and training data. As a design partner, we work with you to define timelines.</dd>
